# Memory Puzzle Game in Python

This is a simple memory puzzle game implemented in Python using the `tkinter` library for the graphical user interface (GUI). The game challenges the player to match pairs of cards within a specified time limit.

## How to Play

- The game will display a grid of face-down cards. 
- Each card has a pair, and the goal is to match all pairs by flipping two cards at a time.
- If two flipped cards match, they stay face-up.
- The game ends when:
  - All pairs are matched.
  - The time limit is reached.

## Features

- **4x4 card grid** with 8 pairs of cards.
- **Time limit**: Players must match all pairs before the time runs out.
- **Timer** shows remaining time as you play.
- **Win or Lose** message appears at the end based on whether you matched all pairs in time.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- `tkinter` (should be included by default with most Python installations)

Game Logic
The game starts with a 4x4 grid of face-down cards. The cards are shuffled, and each card has a number that pairs with another card in the grid. Players can click on two cards at a time to reveal their values. If they match, they remain face-up; otherwise, they are flipped back face-down. The game ends when all pairs are matched, or the timer expires.
